# Intro-to-Programming
Here is my projects from Udacity's course Intro to Programming.

The instructions were to make an animal trading card containing a picture and some facts about the animal I chose. 

## Requirements:
For the image, I had to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If my image was larger, I had to set the image's width to 300 pixels in my CSS. I also had to keep in mind to change the image's alt attribute to the name of my animal. 

Once I had added my favorite animal's image and information, I had to add the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the design-prototype.png by applying the style rules mentioned below. I had to modify card.html to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements I wanted to style.

## Style rules
The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:
• italicized text for the animal's interesting fact <br>
• bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat') <br>
• no dots for the animal's list items <br>
• border around the animal's name, image, and information <br>
• border around the animal's information <br>
• spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
